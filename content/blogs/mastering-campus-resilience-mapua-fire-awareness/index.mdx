### 🔥 Why Fire Awareness Month Matters

March isn’t just about exams and project deadlines. It’s also **Fire Prevention Month**, a time when we highlight one of the most common — yet underestimated — disasters in urban settings like Makati. In schools, dorms, and even coffee nooks, one spark is all it takes.

### 📖 Past Fires That Changed the Game

From the 1996 Ozone Disco Tragedy to recent dormitory fires in Metro Manila, every disaster has taught the same hard lesson: **fire spreads faster than fear**. With just 2 minutes before a room gets engulfed, early action saves lives.

#### 🔢 Fire Facts:
- 🔥 13,029 fire incidents in the Philippines (2023)  
- 🏫 12% occurred in educational buildings  
- ⏱ Average response time: 8–10 minutes

### 🧯 Step-by-Step: What to Do If Fire Strikes in Mapúa

If a fire breaks out during class:

1. **Stay calm.** Alert those around you.  
2. Use the **nearest fire alarm** or call 911.  
3. **Evacuate immediately** using staircases (never elevators).  
4. Cover your mouth with cloth to reduce smoke inhalation.  
5. Assemble at the **designated safe zone**.

📝 *Bonus*: We’ve included a visual infographic at the end of this article.
