You’re half-listening to the teacher’s lecture, staring at the window, when your ballpen tips over by itself. At first, you thought… *oh! maybe your hand just bumped it*—but then you notice that your whole desk is shaking, and you see the windows starting to rattle. You glance around and hear the same confused muttering, and wide-eyed look on your classmates’ faces. Something is definitely wrong.

A loud rumble suddenly fills the room. You heard a scream. The desks start to scrape against the floor as your classmates beneath them jump in panic. The lights above are flickering. Despite your teacher’s best efforts to tone down the noise, to calm the crowd, shouting instructions, everything still seems so scary. The pounds of your heart start to get louder. Now, where will you go? What are you supposed to be doing now?

In moments like this, it’s easy to freeze, but it’s difficult to just follow the chaos.  
**So—What would you do if an earthquake hit during class?**

## A Student’s Guide to Disaster Preparedness

Let’s face it, no one really wants to think about earthquakes or fires until they happen. But when they do, those few moments of preparation can make all the difference. Whether you’re living on campus or commuting, here’s how to stay safe and ready, without going overboard.

### BEFORE THE DISASTER: Small Steps = Big Safety

Begin with the essentials: assemble your emergency kit. If you live in a dorm, consider what you'd require if electricity was lost or you were unable to leave your room for some time.

**Your kit must have:**

- A flashlight (extra batteries or a rechargeable one)  
- A whistle (for calling out for assistance)  
- Canned food and bottled water (a minimum of 3 days' worth)  
- A first-aid kit (keep it simple—bandages, antiseptic, pain killers)  
- Power bank and charging cords  
- ID and a bit of emergency cash  
- Spare set of clothes  
- Hygiene kit (consider toothbrush, soap, hand sanitizer)

**Driving or taking public transport?** You'll want a smaller, more portable kind. Throw in:

- The essentials from above (in smaller form)  
- A few snack bars  
- Comfortable walking shoes (in case you need to walk home)  
- A spare phone charger or power bank

**Your lifeline is on your phone:**

- Save numbers in case of emergency: campus police, fire department, family, roommates  
- Download apps such as *Red Cross* or *ShakeAlert* for real-time notifications  
- Ensure emergency alerts are enabled in your phone’s settings

### DURING THE DISASTER: When Every Second Counts

**Earthquake?** Don't panic, just remember:  
**Duck, Cover, Hold**  
- *Duck* down low so you won't get knocked over  
- *Cover* your head and neck under something sturdy—like a desk or table  
- *Hold* onto that furniture until the shaking stops

**Other tips:**
- Stay away from windows  
- Don’t run outside  
- Expect aftershocks  
- Know your building’s exits in advance  

**If evacuating:**
- Avoid the elevator—take the stairs  
- Descend calmly  
- Help others only if you’re trained  
- Get help for the injured or trapped—don't risk your safety unnecessarily  

Preparing doesn’t mean expecting the worst—it just means being smart. And that feeling of security? Totally worth it.

### AFTER THE DISASTER: Checking in With the University

**What Comes Next?** Once everything has calmed down, it’s crucial to let your school know how you are doing. Whether you’re at home safely, stuck somewhere, or just feeling out of it, the school still needs to hear from you.

**What you can do:**
- Let anyone know you are safe and sound  
- Message your class GC, a classmate, or professor—*“I’m okay”* is enough  
- If affected or injured, report your condition  
- Wait for formal advisories through:
  - Mapúa Official Facebook Page  
  - Student Portals  
  - SMS Alerts  

**Talk to your professors.**  
If your performance or attendance was affected, let them know—most will be understanding and may offer considerations or extensions.

### It’s Okay Not to Be Okay

**Trauma is real.** It’s normal to feel overwhelmed after a disaster. You might feel unsafe or anxious for no reason—and that’s okay.

**Here’s where you can find help:**

- **Mapúa Counseling and Guidance Office**  
  Request a session—even just to talk. Free and confidential.

- **Trusted professors or org advisers**  
  You don’t have to explain everything perfectly. Just start.

- **Friends, classmates, colleagues**  
  Many are likely feeling the same. You’re not alone.

### Visual Tools and Resources

When disaster strikes, your go-bag could make all the difference. As a student, you might not have time to gather supplies during an emergency — so prepare one before anything happens.

### Conclusion

**Preparedness is life.** A disaster may strike at any time, and not having the right information and planning can result in significantly heightened risks. By taking a little time to learn emergency procedures, practicing drills, and staying aware of emergency protocols, we prepare ourselves to respond responsibly.

Let all of us join together in building a culture of readiness on our campus—a culture where every student, every faculty member, and every staff member takes disaster preparedness seriously. Let's make readiness second nature to everyone.
