Disaster, often worsened by climate, threatens lives, health and even the daily work of people. Consequently, Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) not only saves lives but reduces the damage it will have on our community. Moreover, education plays a big role in DRR as this helps spread awareness by empowering people with knowledge and skills to reduce the risk, minimize damage and maintain social and economic stability.

        <ul>
          <li>During the rainy season when floods are very common, one should be extra cautious of the health risks brought by flooding.</li>
          <li>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), flooding or <em>“baha”</em> can increase the prevalence of communicable diseases which can be water or vector-borne.</li>
          <li>WHO explains that water-borne diseases such as typhoid fever, cholera, and leptospirosis are brought by water contamination. The incidents of vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, and yellow fever increase due to standing water that serves as breeding sites for mosquitoes.</li>
          <li>Other risks include tuberculosis, HIV, gastrointestinal infections like diarrhea, tetanus from bacteria in soil or feces, and hypothermia for children exposed to floodwaters.</li>

          <li>Avoid walking, swimming, or driving through floodwaters.</li>
          <li>Always be informed and updated with news on TV or radios.</li>
          <li>Avoid electrical devices, especially when near water.</li>

## Mapúa DRR Framework

In Mapúa University, both Intramuros and Makati Campus, has implemented different policies, protocols, and plans to ensure that students, faculty, and staff are prepared for various types of disasters. These measures include regular earthquake and fire drills, the establishment of designated evacuation areas, and the dissemination of emergency response procedures through orientations and digital platforms. 

Mapúa University also integrates disaster risk awareness into its curriculum and student activities, ensuring that the community is not only informed but also capable of responding effectively during emergencies. By fostering a culture of preparedness and resilience, the university demonstrates its commitment to safeguarding its members and contributing to the broader goals of disaster risk reduction.

## Evacuation Procedures and Routes on Campus

An evacuation procedure always requires modification due to different types of circumstances during a disaster that sometimes requires schools’ to have evacuation drills. The exits in Mapua University Makati are College School entrance and Senior High School entrance while the exits in Mapua University Intramuros are the entrance and exit.
Common Guidelines Include:
- Check if all students have evacuated
- Collect updated class lists
- Guide and stay with students
- Form a line while exiting
- Know nearest exits
- Avoid running or pushing

In times of crisis, access to accurate and reliable emergency contact numbers can be a life-saving resource. Below is a compiled list of essential hotlines from government agencies and disaster response units. Be sure to save these numbers and share them with friends, family, and fellow Mapúans to ensure quick response during emergencies.

## Conclusion

Disaster Risk Reduction is a way to teach people both elderly and children a way to survive during a crisis. It raises self awareness and helps them understand how to stay safe during emergencies. DRR encourages active participation in emergency drills in emergency drills, which enforces key procedures, builds confidence and ensures that students know how to react quickly and effectively during said disasters. This approach helps create a sense of preparedness within the school community.
