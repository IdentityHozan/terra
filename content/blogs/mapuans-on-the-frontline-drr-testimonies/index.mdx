Have you ever experienced an emergency in your life? How has this experience shaped your view of disaster preparedness?

No matter how devastating that experience was, one thing is for sureâ€”that emergencies like these are unpredictable, but how we respond and what we learn from them can shape our entire community. This section is dedicated to learning through shared experiences of the MapÃºan Community. By hearing real stories from students whoâ€™ve faced emergencies inside and outside the campus, we can grow stronger together, better prepared, and more connected.

But before we dive deep into insights from others, let me share with you one of the most traumatic experiences I experienced before. When I think about how emergencies leave an impact, one core memory from my childhood stands out clearly. I was 8 years old, and we were living in our old condo. One night, my father woke the entire family upâ€”there was a loud alarm echoing through the halls of our condo. There was a fire. It turned out the fire wasnâ€™t in our unit, but in a nearby house or establishment. Still, it was close enough to feel real and terrifying. I still have this vivid memory of stepping outside into the pitch-black night and seeing so many people gathered, watching silently as firefighters worked to put it out.

That experience stayed with me. Even as a child, I understood something important that nightâ€”that we shouldnâ€™t take life for granted. And we should always be aware of whatâ€™s happening around us. More importantly, emergencies donâ€™t always come with a warningâ€”and thatâ€™s exactly why we need to be prepared.

Besides a fire, typhoons are also another disaster every student should be well aware of. These are powerful tropical storms that form over warm ocean waters in the Northwest Pacific region. Characterized by strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges, they can cause widespread destruction, especially in coastal and low-lying areas. In countries like the Philippines, typhoons are a common natural hazard, often leading to devastating impacts on communities, infrastructure, and livelihoods. Understanding how typhoons form, their potential effects, and the importance of disaster preparedness is crucial in minimizing the damage they bring.

> ***I can remember the time when the Philippines faced the super typhoon Yolanda, wherein my family had to evacuate because our house during that time was heavily affected due to the heavy rain and strong wind.***

Typhoon Yolanda, internationally known as Haiyan, was one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded. It struck the Philippines in November 2013, bringing sustained winds of over 300 km/h and massive storm surges that devastated coastal communities, particularly in the Visayas region. Yolanda caused widespread destruction, damaging infrastructure, displacing millions, and resulting in over 6,000 deaths. It exposed the vulnerabilities in disaster preparedness and response, especially for communities in low-lying areas.

This account reflects the human impact of this powerful typhoon. He showed how the typhoon's force compromised the safety of even residential structures, forcing people to flee in search of shelter. His experience highlights the fear, urgency, and lack of readiness that many families faced during the disaster, making it a personal representation of the broader national crisis caused by Typhoon Yolanda.

> ***Our family had to evacuate because our house was heavily leaking water as if it were going to fall apart any time soon. We tried to gather as much buckets as possible to contain the leakage but it wasnâ€™t enough.***

Evacuation is probably one of the most essential things needed in any disaster. This helps people move to a safer, more secure location before conditions become life-threatening. When experiencing a typhoon, evacuation can mean the difference between life and death. Strong winds can tear off roofs, collapse walls, and turn debris into dangerous projectiles. Moreover, evacuation reduces the burden on rescuers who may otherwise have to risk their own lives to save those who remain in high-risk areas. It also allows authorities to manage the situation more effectively, ensuring resources are directed where they are needed most. Preparing evacuation plans ahead of timeâ€”and following them when advisedâ€”plays a critical role in disaster readiness and community resilience.

Besides the widespread destruction caused by fire, earthquakes are also considered both a hazard and a disaster. Earthquakes, also called a quake, tremor, or temblor, are the shaking of the Earthâ€™s surface resulting from the sudden release of energy by plate tectonics that creates seismic waves.

> ***i had an experience during last years summer where there was a short but strong earthquake. i was laying on my bed until i felt it shake, i stood up and looked for a place to take cover but the shaking slowed down and eventually stopped before i could walk to a nearby desk***

One thing we should be aware of is that earthquakes can happen anywhere at any time, whether we are at school, inside a building, or in our homes. Disasters like earthquakes start subtlyâ€”maybe a faint vibration underfoot or a creaking sound in the ceiling. You might first think itâ€™s wind, a passing truck, or even your imagination. But then, the movement intensifies. That's why it's important that we know what to do before, during, and after an earthquake.

> ***This experience made me realize the importance of preparation during disasters. Without knowledge of knowing what to do during these disasters, panic would have taken over. This shaped my view on disaster risk reduction as it gets you ready before anything even happens.***

Just like what the statement above said, Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) goes beyond emergency responseâ€“it encompasses the strategies, policies, and practices aimed at minimizing vulnerability and building resilience long before a hazard occurs. It includes everything from public education and early warning systems to sustainable urban planning and infrastructure reinforcement. Through DRR, communities are not only better equipped to survive disasters, but to recover and rebuild more effectively.

Moreover, we invite each and every MapÃºan to be open and share with us your experiences with situations that involve Disaster Risk Reduction. Through your experiences, we uplift each and everyone through encouraging involvement, discipline, and awareness. Your experiences served and will serve as a powerful reminder that preparedness is not optionalâ€”it is essential. As the saying goes:

> *"By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail."* â€” Benjamin Franklin
