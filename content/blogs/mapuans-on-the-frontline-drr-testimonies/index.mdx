Have you ever experienced an emergency in your life? How has this experience shaped your view of disaster preparedness?

No matter how devastating that experience was, one thing is for sure — emergencies like these are unpredictable. But how we respond and what we learn from them can shape our entire community. This section is dedicated to learning through shared experiences of the Mapúan community.

### 🔥 Childhood Fire Experience

When I think about how emergencies leave an impact, one core memory from my childhood stands out clearly. I was 8 years old, and we were living in our old condo. One night, my father woke the entire family up—there was a loud alarm echoing through the halls of our condo. There was a fire.

Although the fire wasn’t in our unit, it was close enough to feel terrifying. I remember stepping outside into the pitch-black night, seeing people gathered as firefighters worked to put it out.

Even as a child, I understood something important that night — we should never take life for granted, and we should always be prepared.

### 🌪️ Super Typhoon Yolanda

> “I can remember the time when the Philippines faced the super typhoon Yolanda, wherein my family had to evacuate because our house during that time was heavily affected due to the heavy rain and strong wind.”

Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan), one of the strongest tropical cyclones recorded, devastated the Philippines in 2013. It brought sustained winds of 300 km/h and massive storm surges, resulting in over 6,000 deaths.

> “Our family had to evacuate because our house was heavily leaking water. We tried to gather as much buckets as possible, but it wasn’t enough.”

Evacuation became a life-saving measure — a reminder of the importance of having plans in place *before* disaster strikes.

### 🌍 Earthquake Experience

> “i had an experience during last year’s summer where there was a short but strong earthquake. i was laying on my bed until i felt it shake, i stood up and looked for a place to take cover but the shaking slowed down and eventually stopped before i could walk to a nearby desk.”

Earthquakes start subtly but can escalate rapidly. Being prepared — mentally and physically — can prevent panic and promote safety.

> “This experience made me realize the importance of preparation during disasters. Without knowledge of what to do, panic would have taken over.”

### 📚 Why DRR Matters

Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) is more than reacting — it’s about anticipating, educating, and empowering. Through shared stories like these, we promote awareness, empathy, and readiness. Emergencies may strike unannounced, but our preparedness is a choice we can make today.

> “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.” — Benjamin Franklin
